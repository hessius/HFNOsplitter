## Preparation

In order to start SHFNO treatment you need not only to produce the supplied 3D models (see next part of the documentation) but also establish treatment guidelines, indications and contraindications etc.
The examples provided in this documentation are not to be seen as the be all and end all, but rather an example of the guidelines at one clinic. These may change over time as our experience with SHFNO grows. Please bear in mind that some details may be highly healthcare system specific.

### Basic guidelines

Any form of HFNO treatment is prescribed by the treating physician.
Administration is based on local recommendations and guidelines (including adaptations of this document).

The nurse or respiratory technician administering HFNO treatment is responsible for matching patients, however, all SHFNO treatments need to be approved by the treating physician.

In COVID-19 the target O2 saturation for otherwise healthy individuals is 92-96 %, whereas in individuals with COPD or other risk factors for CO2 retention the target saturation is 88-92 %.

In COVID-19 the maximum treatment levels are are 30 litres / minute of airflow and FiO2 of 50%.

### Indications for SHFNO

All of the below are met:

- Patient has indication for HFNO in COVID-19.\*
- Patient lacks contraindication for HFNO.†
- Patient lacks contraindication for SHFNO.
- _**No other method of supplying HFNO is currently possible.**_

\*_In this example: Insufficient effect of oxygen therapy using regular nasal cannulae or reservoir masks. Refer to your current guidelines._

†_Refer to your current guidelines_

### Contraindications for SHFNO

Any of the below are met:

- Patient has contraindication for HFNO.‡
- Patient has a _confirmed_ secondary bacterial infection.
  - N.B. Empiric antibiotic treatment does not necessesarily constitute contraindication.
- Patient is a know carrier of drug resistant bacteria.
  - N.B. Screening is not required to be eligible for SHFNO.

‡_Refer to your current guidelines_

### Matching patients

The patients meet, or are expected to meet, all of the below:

- Roughly equal in body size
- Use the same size Optiflow cannula
- In cohort care or can be transferred to cohort care
- Similar treatment requirements
  - When needing to start a new patient on (S)HFNO when all Airvo 2 systems are in use, we recommend matching patients with ongoing HFNO treatment with the same or similar settings so that new patients whenever possible can be started on discrete HFNO until treatment settings are dialed in.
