# Troubleshooting

These instructions are all designed to address a catastrophic situation. If forced to use the SFHNO protocol please take extra precautions. We recommend keeping a reservoir mask by the patient's side at any time when there is ongoing SHFNO.

If a patient were to suddenly deteriorate during ongoing SHFNO, the following checklist needs to be completed in addition to regular protocol. **The checklist should also be completed by the treating nurse at the beginning of every shift.**

### Checklist

For both sides of the setup:

1. **Check Nasal Cannula**

   Is the nasal cannula correctly situated in the nares? N.B. The Airvo system's built-in warning for obstructed flow does not work during SHFNO.

   Ensure that there's no build-up of condensation within the tube leading up to the nasal cannula.

1. **Check all connections**

   Start proximally and work your way distally. Ensure that all connections are securely fitted. If any connection seems loose, try changing adapter or T-connector.

1. **Check CPAP / BiPAP tube**

   Ensure that there are no sharp angles to the tube, restricting flow.

   Ensure that there is no build up of condensation within the tube.

1. **Check AirSpiral tube**

   Ensure that there are no sharp angles to the tube, restricting flow.

   Ensure that there is no build-up of condensation within the tube.

1. **Check collection bottles**

   Ensure that the bottle is securely connected, and that it is not completely filled with fluid.
