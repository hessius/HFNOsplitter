## Models

These designs have all been made from scratch for this project. They use no prioprietary or 3D-scanned information. They are based on ISO standards when applicable. All CAD work has been performed by Erik Cederberg at 3Dverkstan on behalf of the project.

### T-Connector

This connector splits air flow evently and connects the proprietary connector of the distal en of the AirSpiral tube to the proximal end of two CPAP / BiPAP standard tubes.

It also features two drainage points to collect condensation. Two PET bottles are connected here to collect the fluid build up, and between the drainage point there is a splash guard. These features keep condensation from each patient separate. Thus the risk of cross contamination is kept to a minimum.

The design features clear markings so that the setup can be as easy and reliable as possible (also, each connector can only fit in the correct place).

On the back of the connector there as concave surface that fits the pole stand included with the Airvo 2 as well as holes for cable ties.

N.B. the T-connector is available in both a male and female configuration, for the standard setup we recommend using the Male version.

### Adapters

We provide adapters for both the distal end of the AirSpiral tube and the proximal end of the Optiflow Nasal Cannula in two sizes / configurations, a male and female version.

For the core set you need two copies of the male Airvo connector with a male 22mm connector ("Airvo-M-22-M.stl")

## Instructions for manufacture

These prints are made to be printed using readily available resin 3D-printing methods. We recommend using SLA methods, specifically these instructions are based on the Formlabs Form 2 / 3 printers.

We recommend against using FDM / FFM printing as the high humidity and temperature is very suitable for bacterial growth and as FDM produces porous prints which cannot easily be sterilised.

All prints intended for medical use within this project are printed using the Formlabs Surgical Guide or Formlabs Dental SG Resin. These resins are approved for dental use and made to be autoclaved. When using one of these resins our risk assessment has been that the associated risks with the printing material are negligable.

If you attempt to print this on your own, we recommend that you have experience with these types of materials or are able to bring on the assistance of someone with that type of experience.

After validation is complete, we will provide complete printing instructions in the form of .form projects that others are free to use.

For all parts we recommend that you turn off internal supports. For the T-connector we recommend that you rotate the model so that one end of the long axis (so one of the 22mm connectors) is aiming toward the buld plate in a ~50 degree angle, with around 10 degrees of tilt backwards.

For the adapters we recommend that you raise them slightly off the print bed, with the 22mm coupling facing the build plate straight on. This way, support can be avoided on all critical surfaces, ensuring the best possible tolerance level.
