### Core set - Adapter and T-connector

**T-Connector**
This connector splits air flow evently and connects the proprietary connector of the distal en of the AirSpiral tube to the proximal end of two CPAP / BiPAP standard tubes.

It also features two drainage points to collect condensation. Two PET bottles are connected here to collect the fluid build up, and between the drainage point there is a splash guard. These features keep condensation from each patient separate. Thus the risk of cross contamination is kept to a minimum.

The design features clear markings so that the setup can be as easy and reliable as possible (also, each connector can only fit in the correct place).

On the back of the connector there as concave surface that fits the pole stand included with the Airvo 2 as well as holes for cable ties.
