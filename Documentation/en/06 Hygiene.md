## Hygiene

**Water chamber** and **AirSpiral tube** are changed every 14 days, if treatment for both patients is stopped or earlier if needed.

**CPAP/BiPAP tube** and **Optiflow nasal cannula** are both patient specific and changed every 14 days, or earlier if needed. Nasal cannulae should be cleaned daily.

**T-connector** is changed when one or both SHFNO patients are changed, after 7 days or earlier if needed. Please note that when transitioning SHFNO to HFNO and back again with a new patient, the T-connector should be changed. The T-connector is cleaned and reused. The T-connector is cleaned by autoclave according to Table 1 below, or by manual wash and at least 5 minutes submersion in alcohol-based surface disinfectant.

**Adapter** is changed when treatment is stopped for that patient, after 7 days or earlier if needed. The adapter is cleaned and reused. The adapter is cleaned by autoclave according to Table 1 below, or by manual wash and at least 5 minutes submersion in alcohol-based surface disinfectant.

**Collection bottle** is changed when treatment is stopped for that patient, after 7 days or earlier if needed. The bottle is cleaned and reused. The bottle is washed manually, the plastic does not tolerate the temperature acheived when autoclaving.

**Airvo 2** is cleaned according to local guidelines and self-cleaning routine when stopping treatment, after 7 days or earlier if needed. If a need for cleaning arises during ongoing treatment, stop airflow, move the water chamber first, then disconnect the proximal end of the AirSpiral and move over to the new system. The rest of the connections are kept intact. Start treatment on the system with the same settings as the previous Airvo 2 system. After starting treatment again, the T-connector can be moved to the new pole stand.
