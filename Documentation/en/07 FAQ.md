- ### What if our guidelines don't restrict flow at 30 lpm?

  You might still be able to increase your capacity for HFNO by utilising SHFNO when possible.

  A simple example: Let's say you have 15 HFNO system, and 30 patients deemed to benefit from HFNO but only half of them are able to be treated with 30 lpm of air flow.

  Without SHFNO you (obviously) will only be able to treat 15 of those patients. With SHFNO you're now able to treat 22-25 patients instead of 15. Thus SHFNO can be part of a resource utilisation strategy in a crisis situation even though you might not be able to apply it across the board.

- ### What if a patient needs more than 30 lpm?

  Then they are not eligible for SHFNO with the Airvo 2 system.

- ### So should we keep using this after COVID-19?

  No.

- ### Why don't we just buy more systems?

  Please do! If you are able to treat these patients with HFNO by any other means, please do not try this. This is meant as a last resource during a time of crisis.

- ### Why use PET bottles?

  They are ubiquitous, have a standardised connector, are cheap, and they're food safe.

- ### What are the risks associated with this?

  While we are not able to accept any liability for this modified setup, we have carried out a rigorous risk assessment according to ISO-14971:2012 and all identified risks have been addressed in design revisions, documentation and implementation strategy. We advise that you perform, at the very least, a simplified risk analysis.

  Further, one needs to acknowledge the very special circumstanses where the risks associated with not being able to provide treatment might be catastrophic.

- ### What do the 3D printed parts cost?

  The cost of materials is around USD 40. Many print shops now waive the production costs for health care providers. Ask your local shop!

- ### How do I find a local 3D print shop?

  Many universities (and university hospitals) use the types of printers recommended for these types of applications, also larger dental practices might carry these in your area. If you can find a local reseller of the resin you might be able to get information on where to ask for help.

- ### Can you sell me a kit?

  No. This project is strictly non-commercial. You are not allowed to sell kits, however if you produce these for someone else you are allowed to charge for contract manufacturing i.e. materials used and print time reimbursement if applicable.
