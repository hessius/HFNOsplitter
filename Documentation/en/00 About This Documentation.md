## About This Documentation

This documentation is provided as is, and in no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this solution.

With that said, we have undertaken a lot of work to try to make this desperate measure as safe as possible. Both designs and documentation have been put through several iterations in order to ensure optimal clarity, ease of use, safety and reproducability.

We therefore ask for your help - If you find anything that you object to or think could be improved, please share!

This project started at the Västmanland Hospital Västerås in the city of Västerås in Sweden. This documentation is at its core an adaptation of the instructions for use developed in Västerås.

Please read through the whole documentation as every section contains information pertinent to the safety of use.

Healthcare systems around the world now face an unprecedented challenge. Best case scenario, in your system you won't need this. So we keep our fingers crossed that you're reading this in vain. But in the case that your system is already at capacity, we sincerely hope that this project might help bring care to more people.
