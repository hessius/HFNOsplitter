## Validation

Basic validation has now been finished. This has consisted of multiple flow simulations of both air and water flows.

### Air flow

Air flow simulations show that no clinically relevant resistance is added to the system by this project. Air flow is split evenly and the collection bottles are to be considered dead space.
Condensation can however affect air flow, see below.

| This simulation uses an older version of the design with a higher introduced resistance, even with an artifially high resistance the clinical effect is non-existent. | This simulation shows that with the extra unilateral condensation the resistance in one side of the setup is increased causing an uneven airflow that stabilises over time. |

### Condensation

While several steps have been taken to address condensation it is notable that high levels of condensation can affect air flow (see simulation above).

|When removing excess build up of condensation toward the collection bottles at 0 lpm our simulations show that a tiny amount of fluid is able to pass the separator between the bottles. This is only possible at 0 lpm, with large amounts of fluid and if fluid is returned at high speed.|During use at full flow, excess condensation might
