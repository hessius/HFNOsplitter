# Welcome to the HFNOsplitter project - SHFNO.org

This project is dedicated to doubling the capacity for High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) treatment by simultaneously connecting two COVID-19 patients to one HFNO-device by adding 3D printed parts.
This project is currently only aimed at the Airvo™ 2 Optiflow™ system (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited, Berkshire, United Kingdom).
