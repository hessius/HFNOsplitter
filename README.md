# Welcome to the HFNOsplitter project - SHFNO.org

This project is dedicated to doubling the capacity for High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) treatment by simultaneously connecting two COVID-19 patients to one HFNO-device by adding 3D printed parts.
We also provide thorough medical instructions, validation, and risk analysis to enable other healthcare providers to adopt Split HFNO (SHFNO).
This project is currently only aimed at the Airvo™ 2 Optiflow™ system (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited, Berkshire, United Kingdom).
