# Welcome to the HFNOsplitter project

**N.B. 1 This is an ongoing project and is not yet ready for use in patients. We hope that the project will be validated and ready for use around the 7th of April.**

**N.B. 2 Even when ready this solution will be provided as is with no express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this solution.**

This project is dedicated to increasing the capacity for High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) treatment by treating two COVID-19 patients simultaneously using one HFNO-device. This project is currently only aimed at the Airvo 2 Optiflow system.

Treating two patients simultaneously is possible due to
1) Treatment guidelines that stipulate a maximum flow of 30 litres/minute
2) The Airvo 2 system being capable of outputting 60 litres/minute

Treating two patients simultaneously is feasible due to
1) Unidirectional high flow makes cross contamination unlikely
2) Using this only for cohort care with patients with the same disease makes cross contamination less significant
3) HFNO being a completely open system / circuit makes patient factors basically irrelevant for air flow dynamics
4) In the authors' limited experience the COVID-19 patients are often titrated to very similar treatments

This project provides both the parts needed for split HFNO treatment as well as **suggested** instructions for use and manufacture. We also aim to continuously provide the validation from both simulations / calculations as well as real world usage (when ready).

## Summary
HFNO is a valuable treatment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It's importance has risen as many healthcare systems now recommend against using more readily available Non Invasive Ventilation (e.g. BiPAP). The access to HFNO is severely limited. The standard HFNO device Airvo 2 uses only proprietary connectors and cannot be connected to other devices.
**The basic premise of this project is to provide 3D-printable parts to be able to split the HFNO treatment between to patients.**
