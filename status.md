### Finished

- Develop solution
- Risk assessment
- Medical instructions (Swedish)
- Medical instructions (English)
- Validation of prototypes
- First clinically aimed production
- Initial roll out (_First standby usage 2020-04-09_)

### Ongoing

**Secondary validation**<br>
Further flow rate simulations (aiming for final results mid-april)
Direct flow rate measurement (aiming for initial results mid-april)

**Design tweaking**<br>
Introduction of (optional) distal resistance to decrease importance of resistance introduced by e.g. condensation. Initial designs are done and will now be thoroughly simulated and then brought into testing with direct flow rate measurement.

### Pending

- Adaptation to other systems?
